# Hi, I'm Julia!

## About Me:
I am currently a senior at the University of Connecticut pursuing a double major in Economics and Statistical Data Science with a domain in Financial Analysis. I graduate May 2025 and live in the New York City Metropolitan Area. I am passionate about combining my knowledge of economics and data science to build a career that uses data-driven insights to tackle complex economic and financial challenges.

My key areas of interest include statistical learning, econometrics, economic forecasting, and financial analysis. Iâ€™m especially drawn to industries where utilizing these technologies can improve outcomes, such as healthcare, technology, and finance. One of the main reasons I chose this field is the ever-changing nature of it. I enjoy learning new things and continually expanding my skills to stay ahead in a dynamic field.

During the semester I am a Peer Advisor and Tutor for UConn's Department of Economics.
